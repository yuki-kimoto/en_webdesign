<h2> Word-break: break-all | HTML / CSS technique </h2>

If you want to wrap the character string in HTML in character units, specify "word-break: break-all" in CSS.

<pre>
word-break: break-all
</pre>

Even in English, when the width is reached, it will be wrapped in character units instead of word units.
