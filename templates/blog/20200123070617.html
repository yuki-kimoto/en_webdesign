<h2> Make the background glow when you mouse over </h2>

To make the background glow when you hover over it, set a: hover background to a slightly brighter color.

<style>
  .mouse-over-light a {
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
  Width: 100%;
    background: # 2E75B6;
  }
  .mouse-over-light a: hover {
    background: # 3E85C6;
  }
</style>

<div class = "mouse-over-light">
  <a href="/"> The background glows when hovering</a>
</div>

<pre style = "margin-top: 20px;">
<style>
  .mouse-over-light a {
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
  Width: 100%;
    background: # 2E75B6;
  }
  .mouse-over-light a: hover {
    background: # 3E85C6;
  }
</style>

<div class = "mouse-over-light">
  <a href="/"> The background glows when hovering</a>
</div>
</pre>

<h3> How to make a slightly brighter color? </H3>

To create a slightly brighter color, add 1 to the top digit of each element of RGB (Red, Green, Blue). Since the RGB display is a hexadecimal number, 9 is followed by A.

<pre>
# 2E75B6;
</pre>

Since 2E is R, 75 is G, and B6 is B, adding 1 to the top digit gives the following.

<h3> What is the effect of shining when hovering? </H3>

When you bring the mouse up, it glows and you can intuitively press it.

On smartphones, it has nothing to do with it, so you should consider this effect as a supplementary effect and consider a design that you can press just by looking at it.
